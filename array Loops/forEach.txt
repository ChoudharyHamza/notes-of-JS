
forEach loop method:-
			it is very convinient loop method only available for arrays it calls a function for each value 
present in the array and can pass up to 3 parameters which are item its index and finely the array.you can return
it is very convinient as it can be used just like forin loop in python. and note unlike map which returns a new copy 
of the array this method only returns undefined.

syntx:- 
	anyArray.forEach(function(currentItem, itsIndex, completeArrayitself){
										any code can go here });
NOTE:- you can call the function with only one or two parameters you do not need to write all three fi you dont need that
like
syntax:- anyArray.forEach(function(currentItem){
						});

NOTE:- you can also just use a call back function
like 
syntax:- anyArray.forEach(anyFunction)

function anyFunction(item)
{
}


map():- 
	map method is another very useful array methid it is used almost like forEach loop having there paraneters but
 the difference is that the it returns a new copyof the array and not undefined like the forEach loop to put simply the 
map function will mutate the values and return the values in an array new array totaly unlike the faoreacch loop that 
mutates the values of the original loop.

syntax:

var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]


 var arr1 = arr.map(function(item){
			item = item + item;
			return item;
			});
console.log(arr1);
conosle.log(arr);
