

so a function is also a object but instead of prototype they have scope chain which can be considered a type of 
prototype chain and as we can pass a function or return a function as they are object we say javascript has first class 
function

we can pass a function to a function which are called callback functions but when we pass a function we do not 
give parathesis after its name.because we do want to call it later not right now

when we return a function we usualy store the code in the varieble and the retured function can have parameters and we do 
not nessecarily need to pass parameter when we call the function which returns that function we can pass it later when
we call the returned function.
