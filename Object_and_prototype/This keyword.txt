			the this keyword points to the object that is executing the current function. 
			so every function has its owm this keyword whose value is set according to object
			from where it is called. so whenever we define a function the value of this is changed
			for a regular function call it points to the global object but for a method cal in a 
			object it points to that object.
`
			important note:-
				 but when we call a functsion in a method the value of this is again set to global object
