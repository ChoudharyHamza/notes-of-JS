	// ok so there are some things that you need to know when nameing object properties

	//we all now the basic method for nameing an object property.let us say that we want to name the property with two words then we use quotes
			var obj = {
				"the Name": "Hamza"	}
	// now let us say that we want the name to come from the a varieble the how we will do it 
		var symbol = /;
		var obj = {
				[symbol]: "Hamza"	}
	// now if we wanna can a property with twoword name or with varieble the we use
		obj["the Name"];
	// for varieble we can also do the same
		obj[symbol];\


	// there is a way to check if there is a property with the given key in object and why it is nessecary is because you will see that when we call a property that does not exist it will give 		   undefined and not an error so to check we use in opreator it take the key name as a string and returns true if present and false other wise
	// the code will be like this     "property Name" in objectName

	// we can also assign assign
