removechild() :-
		this command is used to remove an element from the dom completly you can use id or class to identify the 
object but it is better to use the id as it is unique for each element and the most oomportant part is that you can not 
remove an element directly you have to go to the parent node of the target element and then you can use the remove child
command to remove the child of that object so you can not delete an element directly

syntax:-
	elementToRemove = document.getElementById('id of the target element');
	elementToRemove.parentNode.removeChild(elementToRemove);

or
	document.getElementById('id of the parent').removeChild('Child id');
