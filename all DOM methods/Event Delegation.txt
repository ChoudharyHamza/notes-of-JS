		 in the javascript there are some cases where the element in which we want to add the event is not present
at the time we load the page or we are IN need to deal with a lot of sub elements and add an event listner to each of them.
here comes a feature of java script handy in html when we initiate an event in an element it will bubble upto the the 
parent element , then to the parent of the parent and so on...  so we can add an event to the parent element and then 
by using the event.target feature to identify and get the element on which the event was initiated this is called event
delegation also

html traversing:-
 		we can travel and get parent or child elements by using property like childNode or parentNode or parentName
this is called html traversing.
