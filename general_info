// BigInt:	
		SO IN JAVASCRIPT WE CANNNOT have vnumbers larger then 2^54 or -2^53 so if we want words longer then this  like while performing cryptography we use BigInt it can store
		variebles with arbitery length (just nay length) to make a varieble into BigInt we needd add n at the end of it

		var BigInt(any name) = 1234567865432456754n;

// multiple ? and : :-
			we can write multiple if else using ? and : how well lets 

			age = 20;
			let message = age<4 ? "baby": age<20 && age >4 : "young" : "old"

// || and && opretors:-  
			when using && opreator it must be kept in mind that the and opreator will find first falsy value and after it the execution will stop
			alert(alert(1) && 0 && alert(3)); the executio will stop because alert(1) retrurns undefined and it considers it falls and execution stops 
			while || opreator will get the first truthy value so lets see
			alert(alert(1) || alert(2) || 1)) the program will continue upto 1 and display one because the rest will return false
