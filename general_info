// BigInt:	
		SO IN JAVASCRIPT WE CANNNOT have vnumbers larger then 2^54 or -2^53 so if we want words longer then this  like while performing cryptography we use BigInt it can store
		variebles with arbitery length (just nay length) to make a varieble into BigInt we needd add n at the end of it

		var BigInt(any name) = 1234567865432456754n;

// multiple ? and : :-
			we can write multiple if else using ? and : how well lets 

			age = 20;
			let message = age<4 ? "baby": age<20 && age >4 : "young" : "old"

// || and && opretors:-  
			when using && opreator it must be kept in mind that the and opreator will find first falsy value and after it the execution will stop
			alert(alert(1) && 0 && alert(3)); the executio will stop because alert(1) retrurns undefined and it considers it falls and execution stops 
			while || opreator will get the first truthy value so lets see
			alert(alert(1) || alert(2) || 1)) the program will continue upto 1 and display one because the rest will return false

// writing numbers with e:- 
				in javascript we can say that e is exponential or simple 1*10^n so let us take example of two numbers

					 var number = 1000000 or 1e6
					 var decinum = 0.000001 or 1e-6
// writing hexa or binary or octa numbers:-
						so in javascript we can use hexadecimal numbers to represent numbers or alot of time colors so we want to write the anme of a number how can we do it

							 for hexadecimal we use 0x like  var num = 0xff   
							 for octadecimal we use 0o like var num = ox377
							 for binary we use 0b var num = bx111111   // all the codes represent 255
						we can also convert a number into hexa octa or binary for by using num.toString(base like 16, 8, 2)
					
// .. after a number or sting to call the methods:-
							so if we use varieble we use num.toString() or we can use 123..toString() so if we are calling a method before a numbe we need to use  '..'  . 

// compareing NaN with NaN:- 
				will return false because NaN is speacial and it cannot be comapred with anything even itself.

// strings are immutable :- 
				the strings in the JS are immutable meaning that they are unchange able we cannot specificly change a character we need to define pr give a whole new string
				if we want to take the text to next line using string just add \n it should do the trick
