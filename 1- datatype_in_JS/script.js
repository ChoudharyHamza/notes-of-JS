// in javscript we have following data types

/*
primitive :-

1- number 
         in javascript we have numbers which can be written with decimal points or not there are no float etc.

2- string 
        the string is just a collection of all types of characters
3- boolean
        boolean can have only two possible values 'true' or 'false'

4- undefined
            undefined is used as a placeholder by the system when we do not assign a value to a varieble.it
            simply means empty or nothing
5- null
        now null is also similar to undefined but the difference is it is mostly used by users and it has the
        datatype of object so it is also an object but we consider it as a datatype.

non-primitive:-

7- object
        the complex datatype in JS are called objects they can contain different type of data types
        the arrays in JS are basicly objects
8- functions

// the typeOf command is used to check the type of any kind of varieble or data type
