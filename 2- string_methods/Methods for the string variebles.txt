

string.length :-
		this is not a method but more of a property and it tells us about the length of the string just like the length of the array.


split():- this is a string method it is used to split the given string into multiple pieces and return an array of it.
syntax:-
var variableToStoreTheReturnedArray = string.split('what charater to use to split the string', limit in number);

note :- (both the parameters are optional)
	if we use ("") in the parameter then the method will split the string into each charater and if use (" ") then by
spaces present between them.and if we omit this parameter then it will return an array with a single string.Optional. 
An integer that specifies the number of splits, items after the split limit will not be included in the array.
