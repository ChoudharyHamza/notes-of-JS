let and const :-

let :-
	it works almost the same as the var statement but a new thing is that ES6 allows block scoping so if we define a 
varieble in the '{}' then the varieble declare withi it with let will be only accessable in that block and not outside this is
called block scoping and it is very useful as it reduces the erroring in naming the variebles. so let is block scoping 
bound .

const :- 
	this satement is used to define a vareible whose value can not be changed and if you declare a 
varieble with const and you dont give it a value then you can not assign a value to it in the later code it will stay undefined.
the value of a const varielbe is unchangeable and cannot be redeclared that is why it is constant.and it is also blolck scoped.
 
important note:-
		we know the concept of hoisting meaning if we decalre a vareible anywhere before after bacuse hoisting declares all 
vairbles at the very start of the execution. the value of the vareible will be 'undefined' if we are using var and calling it before
assigning it value,but it will give an error undeclared vareible if it is declared with the let varieble meaning we can use a vareible
before assiging it value when using var but not  when using let.
